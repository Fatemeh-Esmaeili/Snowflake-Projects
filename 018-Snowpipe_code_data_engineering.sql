--1 how to create an access policy in AWS,
--2 how to create a role associated with that policy,
--3 how to create an integration in Snowflake, and make it aware of our AWS role,
--4 how to edit the AWS role to make it aware of our Snowflake integration.



-- One, in order to use snowpipe with cloud storage, you need to create a snowflake integration object.

-- Two, in order to make the integration object work, you need to give Snowflake the appropriate
-- credentials to communicate with AWS and AWS the appropriate credentials to communicate with Snowflake.

-- Three, the describe integration command allows you to see the info you need to enter into your
-- AWS account for it to trust Snowflake.
